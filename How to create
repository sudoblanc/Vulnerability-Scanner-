Choose a programming language: There are several programming languages you can choose from when developing a vulnerability scanner. 
Some popular choices include Python, Ruby, and Go.

Define the scope: Determine which types of vulnerabilities your scanner will target. For example, you might focus on web application vulnerabilities or 
network vulnerabilities.

Choose a vulnerability database: There are several vulnerability databases available, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Choose the database that best fits your needs.

Choose a scanning tool: There are several scanning tools available, such as Nmap and OpenVAS. Choose the tool that best fits your needs.

Develop the scanner: Write code that will scan a target system for vulnerabilities. 
Your code should use the vulnerability database and the scanning tool you chose.

Test the scanner: Run your scanner against a test system to ensure that it is working correctly.

Add reporting functionality: Once your scanner has completed a scan, it should report any vulnerabilities it found.
You can create reports in various formats, such as HTML or CSV.

Continuous development and improvement: Keep updating and improving your scanner regularly to keep up with new vulnerabilities and security threats.

Note: It is important to remember that vulnerability scanning can be intrusive and potentially harmful to systems. Always seek permission before 
scanning any system and take appropriate precautions to avoid causing damage or disrupting system operations.
